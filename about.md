## About Me
Hello and welcome. 

My name is Kathelyn Zelaya and I was majoring in computer science at Kennesaw State University at the time this blog was active. I participated in the CRA-W CREU program from 2016-2017.

## My Research

My research, titled "Analyzing the Potential of Learning Reading and Math Skills Through Computational Thinking," was conducted with the support of my group mates Deja Tyla Jackson, Erica Pantoja, and Cindi Simmons, and our faculty advisors, Dr. Amber Wagner and Dr. Melissa Driver. Our goal was to explore methods for enhancing the math, literacy, and computational thinking skills of students with learning disabilities through the use of coding.
